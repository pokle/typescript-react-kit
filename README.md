# Typescript + React starter kit

A little starter kit for Typescript and React. To get started, clone a copy:

    git clone https://github.com/pokle/typescript-react-kit hi-typescript-and-react
    cd hi-typescript-and-react
    npm start

Open http://localhost:5000/ after you see the line `webpack: bundle is now VALID.`

# Build and deploy

    npm run build

You can now deploy the contents of the `public/` directory
